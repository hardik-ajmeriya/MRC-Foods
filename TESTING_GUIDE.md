The real-time staff module is now completely integrated and working! Here's how to test it:

---

## 🚀 **Step 1: Start the System**

### Backend (Already Running):
```bash
cd backend && npm start
```
✅ **Expected Output:**
- 🚀 Server running on port 5000
- 📡 Socket.IO server running for real-time updates  
- 📊 Connected to MongoDB: 127.0.0.1

### Frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```
✅ **Expected Output:**
- ➜ Local: http://localhost:5173/

---

## 🧪 **Step 2: Test Customer Flow**

### 1. **Browse Menu** (`http://localhost:5173`)
- ✅ Menu items load from database (not hardcoded!)
- ✅ Categories work dynamically
- ✅ Add items to cart using MongoDB ObjectIds

### 2. **Place Order** (`/cart`)
- ✅ Cart displays items from API
- ✅ Enter customer name and special instructions
- ✅ Click "Place Order"
- ✅ Order gets saved to database with real ObjectIds
- ✅ Navigate to order status page

### 3. **Track Order** (`/order-status`)

---

## 👨‍🍳 **Step 3: Test Staff Dashboard**

## 🔥 **Step 4: Real-time Testing**

### **The Magic Moment!** ✨

1. **Open Two Browser Tabs:**
   - **Tab 1**: Customer order status page (`/order-status`)
   - **Tab 2**: Staff dashboard (`/staff`)

2. **In Staff Dashboard (Tab 2):**
   - Find the customer's order
   - Click **"Mark as Confirmed"**
   - Click **"Mark as Preparing"**
   - Click **"Mark as Ready"**
   - Click **"Mark as Completed"**

3. **Watch Tab 1 (Customer):**
   - ⚡ **INSTANT UPDATES** - No page refresh needed!
   - Progress bar updates in real-time
   - Status changes immediately
   - Estimated time adjusts automatically

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### ❌ **Issue**: "Cast to ObjectId failed"
**✅ Solution**: Fixed! Now using real MongoDB ObjectIds instead of hardcoded numbers.

### ❌ **Issue**: Menu not loading
**✅ Solution**: Menu now loads from database API. Check backend is running.

### ❌ **Issue**: Real-time not working
**✅ Solution**: Check browser console for Socket.IO connection. Should see:
```
👤 User connected: [socket-id]
👤 User [socket-id] joined room: customer/staff
```

---

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

✅ **Backend Console Shows:**
```
👤 User connected: [socket-id]
👤 User [socket-id] joined room: customer
👤 User connected: [socket-id]  
👤 User [socket-id] joined room: staff
📦 Order status update: [order-data]
```

✅ **Frontend Works:**
- No ObjectId errors in console
- Menu items load with real database data
- Orders save successfully
- Real-time updates work instantly
- Staff dashboard shows all orders
- Status updates reflect immediately on customer side

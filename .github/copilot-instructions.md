This project is a React (Vite) + Tailwind + Firebase + PWA college canteen food ordering app. Follow the folder structure and code conventions as described in the README. Use Firestore for real-time order updates and Auth for student login. Use Tailwind for all styling. Prioritize mobile-first, responsive UI. See /src/utils/orderStatus.js for order status enums and flow.
